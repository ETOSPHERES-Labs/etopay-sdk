## Software licensing and open source

We are planning to make the SDK open source and start accepting contribution from the community.

However, till we decide on the best way to move forward with various open source licensing options available, that might suit our needs as well as benefit the developer community, we are currently delivering the SDK under a strict license as shown on the footer of this website.
