# Features

 allows end-users to perform in-app payments to other end-users for services and products offered through the application.

 solves the problem of P2P payments between end-users, by not becoming a gate-keeper, but a path-finder between consumers for digital data, services and real-world commodities

- **Complete Wallet Management with MFA (Multi-factor approvals)**

    For end-users with custodial and non-custodial cryptocurrency wallets without the need of additional approval from regulatory authorities

- **KYC onboarding**

    A completed on-boarding with a full-KYC without ever needing to leave the application and jumping in different browsers.

- **Fiat/Cryptocurrency integration**

    Allows loading cryptocurrency wallets from FIAT bank accounts and vice versa all within the application. Hassle-free and no copy pasting strange character addresses in even stranger browser apps.

- **Multi-user app**

    One end-user or multiple end-users on a single device? We have you covered. Every user on the same end-device can work with the highest assurance that their data cannot be seen by anyone else except themselves.

- **Seamless identity integration**

    We integrate directly with our existing identity providers, to avoid the confusion of re-registration and doing the onboarding for the users again.

- **Integrated invoice and receipt**

    The users need not worry for being conform with the tax authorities. We generate the legally exact receipts and invoices for every user automatically.

- **Multi-platform compatible**

    The solution is provided as an SDK (Software Development Kit) for major application platforms like Android, iOS and Web for developer-easy integration.

- **European Data Center**

    All your data stays in EU and never leaves, replicated or sold to anyone. A fully (really!) GDPR compliant solution with no non-EU entities lurking in the shadows of privacy policy.

- **Cyber-secure**

    A periodic vulnerability assessment and penetration testing ensures that the system is robust against attacks and leaks.
